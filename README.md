Project Title: SKIN TREATMENT USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 

Project Member: Khushi Saroj

Project Description: Skin diseases affect millions of people worldwide, and early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. This project focuses on automating the detection of common skin conditions using deep learning. By leveraging the Xception model, fine-tuned on the
HAM10000 dataset, the system can classify various skin diseases with high accuracy. The model is deployed using FastAPI, allowing users to upload skin images for real-time predictions. Additionally, an AI-powered explanation feature provides insights into the
predicted condition, enhancing user understanding and assisting in preliminary diagnosis. This project aims to make skin disease diagnostics more accessible, efficient, and reliable.
